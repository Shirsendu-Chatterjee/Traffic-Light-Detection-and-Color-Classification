# Traffic-Light-Detection-and-Color-Classification
This project uses the **YOLOv8 object detection model** (Ultralytics) to detect traffic lights in videos and classify their color (Red, Yellow, Green) using **HSV color segmentation** with OpenCV. Based on the detected light color, the system provides an action label: **STOP**, **SLOW**, or **GO**.
